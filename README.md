# Summary

A website to display projects that I have built or contributed to. To build it, I decided to teach myself Material-UI. 

# Technologies

<li>JavaScript
<li>React Hooks
<li>Material UI

# Planning

The design of the site is strongly influenced by <a href='www.purvitrivedi.com'>Purvi Trivedi's<a> work. I love the simplicity and impact of her aesthetic and wanted to try to recreate it by building my site with Material-UI.

To begin, I started with a simple wireframe and focused on how build the site programatically. I also watched a number of tutorials on Material UI to plan my approach to coding the cards.
