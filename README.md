# Summary

A website to display projects that I have built or contributed to. To create it, I decided to learn a new framework and teach myself Material-UI. [Click here](https://www.danparkerprice.com) to visit.  

# Technologies

<li>JavaScript
<li>React Hooks
<li>Material UI

# Planning

The design of the site is strongly influenced by Purvi Trivedi's [work](https://www.purvitrivedi.com). I love the simplicity and impact of her aesthetic and wanted to try to recreate it, while building my site with Material-UI rather than Vue.js.

To begin, I started with a simple wireframe and focused on how build the site programatically. I also watched a number of tutorials on Material UI to plan my approach to coding the UI. 

# Features

<li> useLayoutEffect hook to collapse and display the Skills section of the site on scroll.

# Future Improvements

<li> Although getting to grips with Material UI was a steep learning curve, it was certainly worth the effort; it's a hugely enjoyable framework to use and very intuitive. However, I will continue to work on refining my code.
